# Wallpaper
TabTrekker Wallpaper Setter was made because the TabTrekker addon for Firefox had beautiful pictures from equally beautiful locations that refreshed every day.

However, the folder location changed every day because the location changed every day. Because of this, I decided to make a python script to solve my problems.

I hope you enjoy it!
